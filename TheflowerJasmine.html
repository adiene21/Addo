    <h1>The Flower Jasmine</h1>
    <p>The Flower Jasmine has a hypnotic aura, with ebony as her color cream<br>
The first day I smell her in the garden, her scent occupy my dream<br>
The moon takes over as she glows in the dark; my mind follows<br>
As soon as the sun rises, she becomes invisible as I turn into shadows.<br>
<br>
As she disappears out of my captive sight<br>
The thoughts of her run wild in the cold night<br>
Would fate have it that I could see her again?<br>
Among all the flowers, she is the unique elixir of my pain.<br>
<br>
How am I going to find her now? With my Heart!<br>
Thank to Da Vinci, he has painted a picture of her in his art<br>
Mona LiFa! Sweet is the Flower Jasmine the day I find<br>
You, the river of love flow; as its gates reopens up again in my mind.<br>
<br>
She is mature, educated and beautiful<br>
Her nature is modest, sincere and respectful.<br>
The Flower Jasmine, her scent in me is nothing ephemeral<br>
My undying love for the Flower Jasmine rest eternal!<br>
